<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A double cheeseburger</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 hamburger bun, split</li>
  <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
  <li>1 pinch salt</li>
  <li>4 processed cheese slice singles</li>
  <li>1 tbsp thousand island salad dressing</li>
  <li>1 tomato slice</li>
  <li>1 lettuce leaf</li>
  <li>1 onion slice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Lightly toast both halves of the hamburger bun, cut sides down, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Separate beef into 2 portions and form each into a thin patty slightly larger than the bun. Lightly salt each patty and cook on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip patties over and immediately place two slices of American cheese on each one. Cook until meat has reached desired doneness, 2 to 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Assemble the double cheeseburger in the following order: bottom bun, dressing, tomato, lettuce, beef patty with cheese, onion, beef patty with cheese, and top bun.</li>
